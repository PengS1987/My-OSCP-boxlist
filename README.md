# My-OSCP-boxlist
My list of HackThebox comes primary from the list created by "TJnull at Netsec Focus".
However, the disadvantage of the original list is that it was written more than two years ago. At that time, Active Directory Attacking is not a major part of the OSCP exam. Plus, the boxes are a little bit old.

Therefore, I did more to pass OSCP. These are the boxes I practiced for OSCP:

Some of the boxes are pretty challenging. However, You do not need to hack all these boxes out all by yourself. Remember, we can have notes! Always writing something new down on our notebook is more important than Pwning a machine without help. We are learning. We do not need to prove to ourselves that we are good.

The proving ground boxes I did for OSCP.
Assignment
Bratarina
ClamAV
Clyde
Cobbles
CyberSploit1
Escape
Exfiltrated
Exghost
Fanatastic
Flimsy

Not too many since the policy is that we can only check the outthroughs once per day.
The easy ones are pretty similar with the OSCP exam boxes. If we can only check the outthrought once per day, why don't learn more? That is why I did not do ""Get to Work" boxes too many.
